Greetings,

   I'm applying to show my interest in the Information Security Engineer position in CIS. Information Security seems like a natural progression that would let me put my broader interests in networking, virtualization, containerization, programming, automation, and server systems to use from a position where I can be more effective to the organization.

   I've been implementing and advocating for better information security my whole career, it's always been a passion of mine to build usable and secure systems for my clients and employers. I certified in networking and secure domain design as part of my high school graduation project. My first 'big break' early in my career at Citizens Bank was alerting the senior IT management that their disposal policies were allowing sensitive data to leak, which got me out of a warehouse doing hardware disposal and into a position implementing full-disk encryption for executives and traveling bankers. A few years later, I was responsible for both the policy and implementation of removing 'admin rights' for users, including top leadership. I have built VPNs from scratch and taught PKI and encryption concepts to colleagues. At Brown, I have consistently pushed for endpoints to be more secure, and I think I've demonstrated that I'm willing to push hard on entrenched processes when they need to be changed.
     
   I think I have the right set of skills, knowledge, ethics, and natural curiosity to be an asset to the Information Security Group. I work well with all the members of the team already, and I have experience and knowledge of our people and systems here that will help me get to work quickly.
    
   I look forward to hearing back about this. Thank you for considering me.

-Marc Doughty
